The dialog shows information dependant on the actual BSim installation.

*   At the top, right of the icon, the actual running version number of BSim is shown. The version number, here 3,2,8,2, refers directly to the date of creation and should be read as: BSim version 3, year 2002, August 2. It is possible to check if the latest version is installed by clicking *Help* | *BSim on the Web* ... | *Check for new update* ....

*   Under this you find a field with information about how to contact Danish Building Research Institute regarding BSim-matters.

*   At the right of the above described field, you find a *System Info* field. This field shows information on the operating system and the running version of MDAC. MDAC version 2,5 or more recent have to be installed to run BSim. From BSim version 3,2,8,2 the dialog below is shown at start-up if MDAC is not installed or too old.
