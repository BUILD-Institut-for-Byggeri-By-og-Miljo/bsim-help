# SimView - Oprette en bygning
A building can be created or added by right-clicking in the window with the geometric model view. This calls up the *SimView* menu, where the *Add Building* option should be selected (*<u>E</u>dit* | *Add* | *Building* can also be used). When a building is first created, it will contain one space. This really means that a building is created at the same time as the first space.

The dialog box for creating a building contains 10 fields for entering data:

*   *Name*: The name of the building (choose a sensible name that can be recognised later!).

*   *Space Name*: The name of the space that is being created at the same time (choose a good name!).

*   *X origin*: The origin for the east axis in the non-rotated system of coordinates.

*   *Y origin*: The origin for the north axis in the non-rotated system of coordinates.

*   *Z origin*: The origin for the Z-axis (up) in the model's system of coordinates.

*   *Rotation*: The building's rotation in relation to the global system of coordinates (in degrees), clockwise is positive.

*   *X extent*: The extent of the building in the x-direction – east if the system of coordinates has not been rotated (metres).

*   *Y extent*: The extent of the building in the y-direction – north if the system of coordinates has not been rotated (metres).

*   *Height*: The height of the building (metres).

The measurements describe the location of the **system lines** in the model. When constructions are subsequently attached to the individual faces, they are plotted according to the following convention.

*  <span id="red_text">  **External walls are plotted from the system line inwards.** </span>

*  <span id="red_text"> **Internal walls are plotted with the system line as the centre line.** </span>

Attention **must** be paid to this convention when defining the geometry of the model.
