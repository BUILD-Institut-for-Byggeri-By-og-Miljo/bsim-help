# *tsbi5* - HeatBalance



The *HeatBalance* tab contains a summary of the individual components of the heat balance.

At the top of the tab there are four drop-down list boxes in which the options for displaying the heat balance can be selected. The left-hand list box is used to give the year to show. This option is only available if a period of more years have being simulated. In the second drop-down menu it is possible to select the resolution for the displayed period, i.e. whether the heat balance should be calculated per *week* or per *month* in the columns. The middle list box is used to change between *hours* and percent when counting hours over and above certain temperatures (see rows labeled: *Hours > 21, Hours > 24, Hours > 26 and Hours < 20*). The temperature limits for the count can be changed on the *Options* tab. Counting is performed during simulation and it is thus not possible to extract the number of hours inside a certain time definition, e.g. working hours. If this is needed, it must be done at the [tables tab](https://help.bsim.dk/support/kb/articles/BWzdLlQE/tsbi5---tables). The temperature limits for counting hours can be changed at the *Options* tab. The right-hand menu is used to specify whether the whole building (*TotalBuilding*) or just a single *thermal zone* is to be displayed in the cells below.

The first column always shows a total for the entire period simulated. The subsequent columns show the heat balance by the week or month.

It is possible to save the content of the heat balance table in an external text file for further analyses, e.g. in a spread sheet tool, by pressing "Alt + X" and then selecting name and location for the text file.

An explanation of the individual parameters in the heat balance is found in [*Parameters in the heat balance*](https://help.bsim.dk/support/kb/articles/4966dA9X/parametre-i-varmebalancen).

At the top right of the tab there is a button that calls up a graphical presentation of the results in the form of a bar graph.

If <u>a single column is highlighted</u> the presentation of the results will start with data from that column. At the bottom of the window containing the graph of the results there are four buttons with the following functions (from left to right):

*   Display information on the *ActiveX* application, which is used to display the results in graph form.

*   Go to previous period - if period 1 is being displayed, the graph will change to the total for the period simulated.

*   Go to next period

*   [*Yscale* ](https://help.bsim.dk/support/kb/articles/wmjn7BmV/graph-scale)opens a dialog for fixing the Y-axis or changing the view of the graphs.

*   Close the graphical presentation of the results.

Right clicking the graphical results, a dialog occurs offering the possibility of [modifying the graphical presentation of results](https://help.bsim.dk/support/kb/articles/aWxnxAQV/andring-af-den-grafiske-afbildning-af-resultater).
