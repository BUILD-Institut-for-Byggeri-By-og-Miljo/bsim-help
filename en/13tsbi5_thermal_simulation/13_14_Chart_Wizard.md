# Chart Wizard


Using the built-in templates (*Wizard*) to change the appearance of the graphics is a fast and reliable method. It is possible to choose between 2D and 3D graphics in the first dialog box.


<figure id="center_img">
<img src="./assets/WIZARD2D.GIF" alt="Dialog box for choosing between various 2D representations of results.">
<figcaption>Dialog box for choosing between various 2D representations of results.</figcaption>
</figure>


<figure id="center_img">
<img src="./assets/WIZARD3D.GIF" alt="Dialog box for choosing between various 3D representations of results.">
<figcaption>Dialog box for choosing between various 3D representations of results.</figcaption>
</figure>


When a new representation of the results is chosen, a dialog box offering various options appears.


<figure id="center_img">
<img src="./assets/wizard3d1.gif" alt="Dialog box for detailed structure of the chosen representation.">
<figcaption>Dialog box for detailed structure of the chosen representation.</figcaption>
</figure>


Various options are normally available for the presentation of the chosen graph type.



<figure id="center_img">
<img src="./assets/wizard3d2.gif" alt="Dialog box showing an example of the final graphical representation of data, including the options of assigning a new title (Chart Title), creating a footnote (Chart Footnote) and positioning the key (Chart Legend).">
<figcaption>Dialog box showing an example of the final graphical representation of data, including the options of assigning a new title (Chart Title), creating a footnote (Chart Footnote) and positioning the key (Chart Legend).</figcaption>
</figure>


The last tab shows an example of the presentation of data before the choice is made by clicking the *Finish* button.

If the changes to the appearance of the graph need to be cancelled, it is possible to go back to the start by clicking [*Reset Chart To Defaults*](https://help.bsim.dk/support/kb/articles/rm0x5YmX/chart-designer) on the first tab in *Chart Designer*.
