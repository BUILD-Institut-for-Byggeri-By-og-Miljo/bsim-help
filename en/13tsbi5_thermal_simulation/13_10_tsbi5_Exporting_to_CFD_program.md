# tsbi5 - Exporting to CFD program



It is possible to export the model and the calculated results from tsbi5 in the form of input data for CFD programs.

With tsbi5 as the active program the *<u>F</u>ile* | *Export* | *Geometry* menu option can be selected to export the model's geometry. By this process the function saves the geometry (coordinates of all faces) for use in model description in CFD programs.

The *<u>F</u>ile* | *Export* | *CFD* menu option (does only occur when the *Tables* tab of *tsbi5* is active) saves the results (air and surface temperatures) on a given time of the last tsbi5 simulation as boundary conditions for a CFD program.
