The scale (factor for converting from the drawing's unit of measurement to metres) and tolerance (if the distance between two end points is less than the tolerance, the points are identical) are specified in *Options*.

Select level for floor level and storey height. It is advisable to put the top of the floor on the bottom storey at level 0, as this makes it easier to plot the other storeys.
