# SimDXF - Creating nodes
Construct *nodes* by selecting two non-parallel lines (help lines and/or other lines) + Ctrl+Q, or draw a rectangle over the lines for which nodes are to be calculated + select Make All Nodes (right click + menu selection).

After the first node has been created the window is split in two, the original DXF view and a new SimView view, in which nodes are displayed. *SimView* represents the 3D model.
