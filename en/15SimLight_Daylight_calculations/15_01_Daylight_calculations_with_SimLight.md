It is <span id="red_text"> **only** </span> possible to carry out a daylight calculation with SimLight in spaces where **all** windows (*WinDoor*) are described by exactly four corner points in convex spaces.

It is possible to calculate the daylight conditions at a point or in a plane, which can extend over an entire space.

<div id="gray_background">

<b> NB: </b> <em> SimLight assumes that any calculated space is situated isolated in the universe. This means that spaces with a shared WinDoor of the space in question will have high impact on the results of the daylight calculations in the current space. It is recommended to remove eventual WinDoors between spaces before carrying out a calculation with SimLight. </em>

1. It is <u>only</u> possible to calculate the daylight conditions using SimLight if the rooms are convex.

2.  The influence from neighbor rooms are <u>not</u> taken into account by SimLight. This means that daylight to neighbor rooms will be calculated as if the windows was facing the ambient.

3.  It is <u>only</u> possible to use SimLight in rooms with <u>rectangular</u> windows.
