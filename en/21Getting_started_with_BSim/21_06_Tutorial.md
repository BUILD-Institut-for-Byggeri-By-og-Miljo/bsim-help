# Tutorial


In August 2001, a tutorial for BSim was developed. At that time, version 2.1.8.7 of the BSim2000 program was used. Although many changes have been made since then, many functions remain the same, and the tutorial can provide new users of BSim with a good introduction to the basic concepts and functionality.

The tutorial was prepared at BYG-DTU by:

*   *Diploma Engineer Johnny Madsen*

*   *Diploma Engineer Anders Schepler*

*   *Diploma Engineer Jon Gjørlund*

under the supervision of *Associate Professor Kaj Christensen*.

The tutorial (6.1 MB in PDF format) is not part of this user guide/help, but can be downloaded via the BSim pages on the Internet under the [literature](https://bsim.outseta.com/support/kb/articles/A93zbqQ0/litteratur) section.
