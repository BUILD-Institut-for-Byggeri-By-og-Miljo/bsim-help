# Building model updates
In the table below there is a list of changes in the BSim building model. A description of how to update a building model created in a old version of BSim to ne used in the current version of BSim.   
* The version number in the left column of the table shows in which BSim version a change was implemented. All changed shown above the actual version number must be made to carry out a simulation in a new BSim version using a building model created in an old BSim version.

The user will be prompted if this overview are to be shown if an old building model is opened in a new version of BSim if the option "Check model version" is active in the [Options dialog](https://help.bsim.dk/support/kb/articles/LmJv8EmP/simview---options). Focus will be on the BSim version in which the building model was created.
