*   Describe your problem so it is clear from your e-mail alone.

*   Describe the model with special emphasis on those parts giving the problems.

*   Attach eventually the model- (*\<model name\>.dis*) and the database file (*\<model name\>.mdb*).

*   Try to reduce the complexity of the model to ease the understanding and to ensure that it is not an error elsewhere in the model causing the problems (giving unexpected results).
