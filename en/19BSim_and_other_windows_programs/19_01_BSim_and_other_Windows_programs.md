# BSim and other Windows programs
*BSim* is a genuine Windows program, i.e. everything copied from its user interface can be pasted into other Windows programs.

As in other Windows programs, copying is done by pressing *Ctrl + c*. Graphics are copied by right-clicking in the graphical representation and selecting *Copy* in the menu. When this happens the graphics and the data forming the graphics are copied to the Windows clipboard. The copy is normally pasted into the desired Windows program from the clipboard using *Ctrl + v* or *Shift + Insert*.

**Word-processing software:** If copied graphics are to be pasted into MS Word, for example, *Paste Special* has to be used. This allows the type of material for pasting to be selected (e.g. picture). For a precise description of the procedure see also the documentation for the programs in which copied material is to be pasted.

**Spreadsheet software:** If the results are to be processed in a spreadsheet program, *Ctrl + v* or *Shift + Insert* can be used to paste the data for the copied result graphics. The numerical values are pasted and further processing and graphical presentation can be done in the spreadsheet program. See also the documentation for the relevant programs.
