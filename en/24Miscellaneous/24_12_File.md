*   *<u>N</u>ew*: Starts the [wizard](https://bsim.outseta.com/support/kb/articles/1Qpn73WE/chart-wizard) to create a new model. The user is asked whether the current model should be saved before the software switches to creating the new model.

*   *<u>O</u>pen* ...: Opens a dialog for opening an existing project

*   *Browse*...: Opens a dialog with preview of model geomery to find and open existing models.

*   *<u>S</u>ave*: Saves the model under its current name. A back-up file is created when this function is used.

*   *Save <u>A</u>s* ...: Saves the model under a new name. A back-up file is created when this function is used.

*   *Recover*: Opens a dialog box that allows a [backup copy](https://bsim.outseta.com/support/kb/articles/LmJv8EmP/options) of the model to be opened if the program has crashed for one reason or another.

*   *Data Base* ...: Allows a new default database and a new model database to be selected.

*   *Copy Project To* ...: Creates a copy of the actual project in an other folder and eventual a new name. The correct data base is copied to the same folder as the project.

*   *Mail Project To* ...: Opens the standard e-mail application for sending a new e-mail and attaches the current model and database to the e-mail. The database file will automatically be renamed to *.disdb to avoid removal by the e-mail security system.

*   *Export* ...: (When <span id="red_text">***SimView***</span> is active!):

    *   *Radiance*: Saves the model geometry and eventual informations about [furface properties](https://help.bsim.dk/support/kb/articles/BWzdbgQE/simdb---buildingmaterial-finish) in an exsternal file which can be read into the [Radiance](https://bsim.outseta.com/support/kb/articles/A93zY5Q0/eksport-af-data-til-radiance) program.

    *   *DirectX*: (from BSim version 2002) Saves the geometry in an exsternal file (*.x) which can be read into a graphics program supporting the [DirectX technology](https://help.bsim.dk/support/kb/articles/7mawjM9E/visualisering-med-directx).

    *   *Bitmap*: When the 3D image is active - left click in the 3D image to activate - a bitmap (*.bmp) graphic file of the graphic can be saved to disk.

*   *Export* ...: (When <span id="red_text">***tsbi5***</span> is active!):

    *   *Save Log As* ...: (appears only when *tsbi5* | *Options* is active) Ssaves the results log in a new name. The functions is useful for analyses of parametric variations.

    *   *tsbi3*: Saves the model in a format that can be opened in the tsbi3 program

    *   *Geometry*: Saves the geometry (coordinates for all faces) for use in model description in a CFD program

    *   *CFD* (only possible when the *Tables* tab of *tsbi5* is active): Saves the results of a tsbi5 simulation as boundary conditions for a CFD program

*   *Weather Data*: (when <span id="red_text">***tsbi5***</span> is active):

    *   *Convert*: Opens a dialog for [Converting Weather Data](https://bsim.outseta.com/support/kb/articles/1Qpng0WE/konvertering-af-vejrdata-til-tsbi5) in ASCII (text) format to the binary format used in tsbi5.

    *   *ASHRAE* (from BSim version 2002 only): Opens a [dialog]() for download and automatic conversion of free ASHRAE climate data from the Internet.

*   *<u>P</u>rint*: Prints the documentation for the model corresponding to[ *ModelList*](https://help.bsim.dk/support/kb/articles/ZmNr2Em2/simview---udskrift-af-model).

*   *Print Pre<u>v</u>iew*: Displays the printout of *ModelList* on screen.

*   *P<u>r</u>int Setup* ...: Opens a dialog box for changing printer and printer properties.

*   *Printer Font*: Opens a dialog box for selecting a font for printing ModelList.

*   *<u>1</u>*, *<u>2</u>*, *<u>3</u>* and *<u>4</u>*: The names of the last four projects to be opened. Clicking one of the names opens the project.

*   *E<u>x</u>it*: Closes *BSim*.
