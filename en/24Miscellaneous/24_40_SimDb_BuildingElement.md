# SimDb BuildingElement

BuildingElement occurs as the first tab when an entry from the BuildingElements part of the database is opened and when a new building element is being created. If the tab is revealed from an existing entry in the database, the SfB field will be inactive.

The SfB number is selected from the tree summary in the window on the right of the dialog box and put in a suitable category. Information on the unit of *measurement* and the element's expected *lifetime* is only used in connection with LCA analyses.
