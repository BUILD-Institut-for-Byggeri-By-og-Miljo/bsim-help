# WinDoor Override
The area of the glass is calculated from these data. All the fields can be zeroed by clicking the *Clear* button, after which the software will make a new area calculation based on the geometry of the opening and information from the database on the frame type.

From the database the following information is known: Glass properties, heat loss through spacer, width and thermal properties of the frame and size (percentage of the opening in the wall) of an eventual panel to be used if the WinDoor is a door.
