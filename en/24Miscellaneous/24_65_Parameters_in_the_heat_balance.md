# Parameters in the heat balance

At the HeatBalance tab a number of parameters are found informing about the different contributions (qXxxxxxxx in kWh) to the heat balance for the building or the individual thermal zones. Additional to this there are a number of parameters of common interest for the evaluation of the indoor climate and the gross energy consumption.

*   *tOutdoor mean* is the average value (in the selected time scale) of the ambient temperature.

*   *tOp mean* is the average value of the operative indoor temperature in the building or the selected thermal zone.

*   *AirChange* shows the average air change rate (air changes per hour) in the building or the zone.

*   *Rel. Moisture* is the average relative humidity (%) in the building or the zone.

*   *Co2* shows the average content in ppm of CO<sub>2</sub> in the indoor air.

*   *PAQ* shows the calculated [Perceived indoor Air Quality](https://help.bsim.dk/support/kb/articles/4966Zl9X/oplevet-indeluftkvalitet-paq).

*   *Hours > 21, Hour > 25, Hour > 28 and Hour < 20* shows the number of hours with an operative indoor temperature above and below certain given limits (the limits can be changed at the *[Options](https://help.bsim.dk/support/kb/articles/nmDBKR9y/tsbi5---options)* tab) in the selected thermal zone within the selected time resolution, e.g. week or month. If the entire model is selected, no values are shown.

*   *FanPow* shows the used electrical energy (kWh) for running the fans in the ventilation system(s). The used power is calculated based on the given pressure rise in the ducts (inlet and outlet).

*   *HtRec* shows the amount of energy (kWh) (heat) recovered in the heat recovery unit of the ventilation system(s).

*   *ClRec* shows the amount of energy (kWh) (cooling) recovered in the cooling recovery unit of the ventilation system(s).

*   *HtCoil* is the amount of energy (kWh) used in the heating coil of the ventilation system(s) for heating the inlet air.

*   *ClCoil* is the amount of energy (kWh) used in the cooling coil of the ventilation system(s) for cooling the inlet air.

*   *Humidif* is the amount of energy (kWh) used for humidification of the inlet air in the ventilation system(s).

*   *FloorHeat* is the amount of energy (kWh) used for heating the constructions in floor heating and cooling systems.

*   *FloorCool* is the amount of energy (kWh) used for cooling the constructions in floor heating and cooling systems.

*   *HeatPump* is the energy added (kWh) from a heat pump.

*   *HeatPumpElCons* is the use of electricity (kWh) in the heat pump.
