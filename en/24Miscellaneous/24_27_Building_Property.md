*BUILDING* informs about the gross and net volume of the current building.

*   *Hide View* offers the possibility to hide the geometric drawing of the actual building - especially useful in large models with more buildings.

*   *Rotation* is the rotation of the model. A positive value will rotate a North facing face towards East.

*   *Height:* Is the total height of the building. This number is used when simulating natural ventilation to calculate the correct wind pressure if only a part of the building have been modeled.

*   *Current Building* tells BSim which building (if more than one exists in the model) to simulate in XSun and tsbi5.

*   *Site* informs about the current site (the geographic location and climate) of the model.

*   Information on the *design heat loss* of the current building is found under the *Site-caption*. This value is calculated from the U-values of the constructions and the design temperatures given at the [*Heatloss* ](https://help.bsim.dk/support/kb/articles/dQG2oem4/model-information)tab from the [*Defaults* ](https://help.bsim.dk/support/kb/articles/y9gBKGQM/standardkonstruktioner)menu entry in the *[SimView-menu](https://help.bsim.dk/support/kb/articles/49EdrJQ7/simview-menu).* The design heat loss will **only** be shown if the design temperatures on the *Heatloss* tab have been accepted by clicking OK.
