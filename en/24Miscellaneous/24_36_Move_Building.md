# Move: Building

A building in the model can be moved in the global co-ordinate system by selecting the building in the tree structure and using the *Move* entry of the *SimView*-menu. This opens a dialog for defining the distance (in meters) to move the building in the X, Y and Z directions.

If a vertex of a face is selected (shift+click or double-click) in advance of the *Move* operation, the input fields at the right of the dialog will be active. This offers the possibility of changing the proportions (scaling) of the building in the 3 major axis directions (X, Y, Z) and rotate the building around a vertical axis through the selected vertex. *When changing the scaling, the values of all vertexes in the actual axis direction will be multiplied with the scaling value*.
