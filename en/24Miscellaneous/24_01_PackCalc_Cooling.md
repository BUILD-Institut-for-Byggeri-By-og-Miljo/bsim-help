Pack Calculation is an application for comparing the yearly energy consumption of refrigeration plants. Among other features, transcritical CO<sub>2</sub> systems can be compared with traditional systems.

The application makes this comparison based on a geographical location.

In the current version, the application contains models of 11 commonly used refrigeration cycles and more than 4000 commercially available compressors.

The application is developed together with both Danish and international companies and the development is partly financed by Dansk Energi as part of the ELFORSK R&D program.
