# Termisk simulering
The thermal simulation of a buildings *thermal zones* is made in the *tsbi5* program. Simulations in *tsbi5* are carried out for the current building. If there is more than one building in the model ([shadows from surroundings](https://bsim.outseta.com/support/kb/articles/E9LwJGQw/skygger-fra-omgivelser)), the current building will be marked in bold types in the tree structure.

The current building ca be selected by right-clicking the desired building and putting a mark in the *Current Building* box. This act removes the *CurrentBuilding* mark from any other building.

*tsbi5* is a Windows-based successor *tsbi3* with some improvements and changes. Compared to *tsbi3* especially the introduction of a full 3D-geometry is a distinct change and the graphic representation of the model. Beside this minor changes have been made in connection with the control of ventilation systems and there can be calculated a temperature stratification in high rooms. Finally there has been established a connection to the [*XSun*](https://bsim.outseta.com/support/kb/articles/amRGdMQJ/analyse-af-solindfald-med-xsun)-program, which creates the possibility for more precise calculations of the solar distribution in a room.

The simulation program is started by pressing the icon for [*tsbi5*](https://bsim.outseta.com/support/kb/articles/A93z0lQ0/tsbi5).
