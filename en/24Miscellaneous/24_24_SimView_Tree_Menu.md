# SimView – Tree Menu

By right-clicking in the tree structure on the left side of SimView, a menu is opened which provides access to various functions for editing the model at a global level.

The menu entries allow the following functions to be called:

* *Properties*, which opens the [Building Property]() dialog for the building in the model that is currently selected.

* [*Add Site*](), which attaches a site (location) to the model.

* [*Insert Thermal Zone*](), which adds a thermal zone to the currently selected building in the model each time the function is called.

* [*Insert Defaults*](), which opens a dialog for overwriting the default values of the constructions with the values that are currently selected.
The values for the default constructions can be changed via *Defaults* from the [SimView menu]().
