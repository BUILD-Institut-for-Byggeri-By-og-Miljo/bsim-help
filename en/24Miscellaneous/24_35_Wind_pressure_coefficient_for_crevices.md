# Wind pressure coefficient for crevices

Used in the simulation of ventilated constructions and the possible transport of air (evenly distributed infiltration) by diffusion through the construction.

Four wind pressure coefficients, one for each main compass direction, must be defined for the opening in the top and the bottom of the crevice in constructions facing the ambient. A standard equation is being used to calculate the wind pressure coefficient for any wind direction (the green line in the graph).
