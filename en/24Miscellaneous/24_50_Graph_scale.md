*Minimum* indicate the minimum value of the Y-axis and *Maximum* the maximum value. *Divisions* is the distance between the sub-divisions of the Y-axis. Using the tick *AutoScale* it is possible to turn the auto-scaling on and off.

*Chart Type* can only be selected from the graphic representation of the [heat balance](https://help.bsim.dk/support/kb/articles/wmjn57mV/tsbi5---heatbalance). The *Chart Type* drop-down menu offers the possibility of selecting 4 different types of graphic representation of the results: bar diagram (default), 2D (seen from the top) pie diagram, 3D pie diagram and 3D doughnut. In the last three types both heat losses and heat gains are shown by their numerical values. The total area do in this way represent **both** heat gains (+) **and** heat losses (-).
