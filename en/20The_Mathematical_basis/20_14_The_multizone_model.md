This section describes the implementation of the multi-zone model (mzm) and the areas where BSim is important for its implementation. The section consists of three parts:

1.  [Description of the BSim systems for air exchange](https://help.bsim.dk/support/kb/articles/gWKDvkmp/systemer-til-luftudveksling)

2.  [Implementation of the multi-zone model](https://help.bsim.dk/support/kb/articles/z9MKwym4/implementering-af-mzm)

3.  [Control systems in the multi-zone model](https://help.bsim.dk/support/kb/articles/7mawyJ9E/regulering-af-multizone-modellen)

The first section describes BSim, the second section presents the multi-zone model and the third section describes the interaction between BSim and the multi-zone model.
